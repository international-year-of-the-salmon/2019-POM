Protocols for Particulate Organic Matter Data from the 2019 Gulf of Alaska International Year of the Salmon Expedition


Collecting samples 

1.	Five liters of water collected from the photic zone (5m depth) using Niskin bottle 
2.	Replicate 2L POM samples collected by vacuum filtration, one to be acidified and the other not to be acidified. 

Filtering the samples 

Filtration is performed with a vacuum pump: 
1.	Load 25 mm filter funnel with pre-combusted and pre-weighed 25 mm GF/F filter. 
2.	Invert sample bottle to mix water and rinse measuring jugs with sample water prior to filtering. 
3.	Filter 2 liters of water through filter 
4.	Do not let the pressure exceed -0.4 bar (-12 inHg). 
5.	Take care not to let the filter run dry. This will cause phytoplankton cells to rupture. 
6.	Once all water has been filtered close the filter funnel stopper and turn off the pump. 
7.	Make sure that the volume of water filtered to the point of termination is recorded. 
8.	Lift the rubber stopper to release the pressure then carefully remove the filter using flat filter forceps. Fold filter in half (inwards) using two pairs of forceps and place into numbered squares of aluminum foil. 
9.	Fold the foil square along the edges to seal the package. 
10.	Label the filter and record the exact volume filtered with sharpie on the tinfoil packet. Record that the Sample Type is “POM”. 
11.	For each filter record the filter number, the station depth and date, and the volume filtered on the station sheet. 

IF ACIDIFYING: 
12.	After filtration lift the rubber stopper to release the pressure then add 2.5 of 1 M HCl (made with 0.7 µm filtered seawater) to the filter funnel using a pipette. 
13.	Let the HCl bathe the filter for 30 seconds. 
14.	Open the funnel stopper and drain the HCl, rinsing briefly with 0.7 µm filtered seawater sprayed around the funnel, never directly on the filter. 
15.	Label the filter that was acid treated with an “A”. Record the exact volume filtered with sharpie on the tinfoil packet. Record that the Sample Type is “POM”. 
16.	For each filter record the filter number, the station depth and date, and the volume filtered on the station sheet. 

Filter Storage 

1.	Place filters in a labelled Ziplock bag (POM) and store in a -20°C freezer until drying.
