Protocols for Particulate Organic Matter Data from the 2019 Gulf of Alaska International Year of the Salmon Expedition


Collecting samples 

1.	Five liters of water collected from the photic zone (5m depth) using Niskin bottle 
2.	Replicate 2L POM samples collected by vacuum filtration, one to be acidified and the other not to be acidified. 

Filtering the samples 

Filtration is performed with a vacuum pump: 
1.	Load 25 mm filter funnel with pre-combusted and pre-weighed 25 mm GF/F filter. 
2.	Invert sample bottle to mix water and rinse measuring jugs with sample water prior to filtering. 
3.	Filter 2 liters of water through filter 
4.	Do not let the pressure exceed -0.4 bar (-12 inHg). 
5.	Take care not to let the filter run dry. This will cause phytoplankton cells to rupture. 
6.	Once all water has been filtered close the filter funnel stopper and turn off the pump. 
7.	Make sure that the volume of water filtered to the point of termination is recorded. 
8.	Lift the rubber stopper to release the pressure then carefully remove the filter using flat filter forceps. Fold filter in half (inwards) using two pairs of forceps and place into numbered squares of aluminum foil. 
9.	Fold the foil square along the edges to seal the package. 
10.	Label the filter and record the exact volume filtered with sharpie on the tinfoil packet. Record that the Sample Type is “POM”. 
11.	For each filter record the filter number, the station depth and date, and the volume filtered on the station sheet. 

IF ACIDIFYING: 
12.	After filtration lift the rubber stopper to release the pressure then add 2.5 of 1 M HCl (made with 0.7 µm filtered seawater) to the filter funnel using a pipette. 
13.	Let the HCl bathe the filter for 30 seconds. 
14.	Open the funnel stopper and drain the HCl, rinsing briefly with 0.7 µm filtered seawater sprayed around the funnel, never directly on the filter. 
15.	Label the filter that was acid treated with an “A”. Record the exact volume filtered with sharpie on the tinfoil packet. Record that the Sample Type is “POM”. 
16.	For each filter record the filter number, the station depth and date, and the volume filtered on the station sheet. 

Filter Storage 

1.	Place filters in a labelled Ziplock bag (POM) and store in a -20°C freezer until drying.

Sample Analysis at UC Davis

From https://stableisotopefacility.ucdavis.edu/carbon-and-nitrogen-solids

The SIF provides 13C and 15N isotope analyses of solid materials, such as soils, sediments, plant and animal tissues, etc., using an elemental analyzer interfaced to a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). For most sample types, we analyze both 13C and 15N in the same sample. For samples with high C:N ratios (typically greater than 100) separate samples are required for 13C and 15N.

Analysis
The SIF has multiple EA-IRMS systems including different hardware configurations.

Animal tissue and small plant samples are analyzed for 13C and 15N isotopes using a PDZ Europa ANCA-GSL elemental analyzer interfaced to a PDZ Europa 20-20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Sercon Ltd., Cheshire, UK). Samples are combusted at 1000°C in a reactor packed with chromium oxide and silvered copper oxide. Following combustion, oxides are removed in a reduction reactor (reduced copper at 650°C). The helium carrier then flows through a water trap (magnesium perchlorate and phosphorous pentoxide). N2 and CO2 are separated on a Carbosieve GC column (65°C, 65 mL/min) before entering the IRMS.

Larger plant samples, glass fiber filters, soils, and sediments are analyzed for 13C and 15N isotopes using an Elementar Vario EL Cube or Micro Cube elemental analyzer (Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Hanau, Germany) interfaced to either an Isoprime VisION IRMS (Elementar UK Ltd, Cheadle, UK) or a PDZ Europa 20-20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Sercon Ltd., Cheshire, UK). Samples are combusted at 1080°C in a reactor packed with chromium oxide and silvered copper oxide. Following combustion, oxides are removed in a reduction reactor (reduced copper at 650°C). The helium carrier then flows through a water trap (magnesium perchlorate and phosphorous pentoxide). CO2 is retained on an adsorption trap until the N2 peak is analyzed; the adsorption trap is then heated releasing the CO2 to the IRMS.

During analysis, samples are interspersed with several replicates of at least four different laboratory reference materials. These reference materials have been previously calibrated against international reference materials, including: IAEA-600, USGS-40, USGS-41, USGS-42, USGS-43, USGS-61, USGS-64, and USGS-65) reference materials. A sample’s provisional isotope ratio is measured relative to a reference gas peak analyzed with each sample. These provisional values are finalized by correcting the values for the entire batch based on the known values of the included laboratory reference materials. The long term standard deviation is 0.2 ‰ for 13C and 0.3 ‰ for 15N.

The final delta values, delivered to the customer, are expressed relative to international standards VPDB (Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite) and Air for carbon and nitrogen, respectively. For information on delta notation and the international references, please refer to a stable isotope reference such as Sharp, Z. (2005) Principles of Stable Isotope Geochemistry (Prentice Hall).
